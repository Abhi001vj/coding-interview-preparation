Summarized Patterns, Question Types, and DSA Techniques

Overall Patterns Observed:

Graph Traversal: A very common theme, appearing in many forms from basic reachability to multi-source pathfinding, graph building and DFS/BFS traversal

Dynamic Programming (DP): From subsequence problems, optimization problems, to problems which need memory of states for repeated computations

Interval Problems: Merge intervals, often with extra conditions or queries.

Greedy Algorithms: Used for optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.

String Manipulation: String processing and pattern matching.

Top Types of Questions:

Graph Algorithms: Questions revolve around graphs include reachability, shortest paths, cycle detection, component analysis, and tree traversals.

Dynamic Programming: Optimization problems, sequence problems, counting problems using dp.

Interval Manipulation: Merge intervals, check intersections, etc.

String Processing: Pattern matching, creating subsequences, or making changes to achieve a specific output.

Array manipulation with sliding windows and monotonic stacks/queues

Math and Logic: Combination of graph, tree and dp problems with logical questions to check for edge cases and reasoning .

Key Data Structures and Algorithms Used:

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization/Tabulation

Greedy Algorithms

Union-Find/Disjoint Set Union

Monotonic Stack

Trie Data structure

Segment Trees

Fenwick Tree/Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)

Merge Sort

Sliding window

Hash Maps/Sets: For tracking, lookup, etc

Binary Search

Priority Queues/Heaps: For scheduling and finding min/max values

Additional Notes:

Follow-up Questions: Interviewers often asked follow-up questions to test the depth of understanding and ability to adapt solutions.

Optimization: Optimizing for both time and space complexity is crucial

Communication Skills: Clearly explaining your thought process, asking clarifying questions, and discussing different approaches are all important parts of the interview process.

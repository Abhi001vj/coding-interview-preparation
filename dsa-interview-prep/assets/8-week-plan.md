# 8-Week DSA Interview Preparation Plan

## Overview

This plan is designed specifically for Abhilash based on:
- Google feedback: "good ideas but inefficient algorithm, buggy codes and slow progress"
- Meta feedback: "coding interviews weren't quite strong enough"
- Key gaps: Snapshot/Versioning patterns, Union-Find, time management

### Goals
- Master 12 core algorithm patterns
- Solve 100+ problems with <25 min average for mediums
- Zero-bug rate >80% on first submission
- Pass 2 medium problems in 45 minutes consistently

### Daily Time Commitment
- Minimum: 2 hours/day
- Recommended: 3-4 hours/day
- Weekend: 4-5 hours/day (including mock interviews)

## Weekly Review Questions

Every Sunday, answer:

1. **What patterns am I still slow on?**
   - Action: Add to next week's focus

2. **What bugs am I repeating?**
   - Action: Add to common-bugs.md personal section

3. **Am I meeting time targets?**
   - If no: Reduce problem difficulty, focus on speed

4. **What topics need more practice?**
   - Action: Adjust next week's schedule

5. **Mock interview feedback themes?**
   - Action: Targeted practice on weak areas

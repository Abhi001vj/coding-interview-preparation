# You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

# Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

# 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
# i + j < n
# Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
# Output: 2
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
It's guaranteed that you can reach nums[n - 1].

Jump Game II - Comprehensive Solution Analysis
=========================================

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach
the last index, where each number represents the maximum jump length from
that position.

Let's explore multiple approaches to solve this:
1. Dynamic Programming
2. Greedy with BFS-like approach
3. Optimized Greedy

Key Insights and Patterns:

1. Dynamic Programming vs Greedy:
   - DP considers all possibilities
   - Greedy makes locally optimal choices
   - Trade-off between completeness and efficiency

2. BFS-like Thinking:
   - Each jump is like a level in BFS
   - Track maximum reachable positions
   - Minimize number of levels/jumps

3. Optimization Techniques:
   - Track ranges instead of individual positions
   - Look ahead to make better choices
   - Early termination when possible

4. Important Considerations:
   - No need to jump from last position
   - Can always reach end (given)
   - Maximum jump vs optimal jump
   - Handle edge cases (single element)
"""
```

Each approach offers different insights:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Most intuitive approach
   - Shows optimal substructure
   - Good for understanding problem structure
   - Less efficient than greedy approaches

2. **Greedy BFS**:
   - Views problem as level traversal
   - More efficient than DP
   - Natural way to minimize jumps
   - Shows connection to graph algorithms

3. **Optimized Greedy**:
   - Most efficient solution
   - Maintains minimal state
   - Shows power of range tracking
   - Best for actual implementation

1. Explain any specific approach in detail?
2. Add more examples or visualizations?
3. Discuss specific optimizations?
4. Show how to handle different variations of the problem?

The key points to understand about this solution:

1. **Why Backtracking?**
   - It explores all possible paths to find the minimum jumps
   - It can prune paths that won't lead to a better solution
   - It works backwards from larger jumps to smaller ones

2. **How it Works:**
   - At each position, it tries all possible jumps
   - It starts with the largest possible jump first
   - When it reaches the end, it updates the minimum jumps needed
   - It backtracks to try other paths

3. **State Management:**
   - `i` tracks current position
   - `jumps` tracks number of jumps taken
   - `smallest[0]` stores the minimum jumps found so far
   - Using list for `smallest` to modify it in recursive calls

4. **Optimization:**
   - Only explores paths that could lead to better solutions
   - Tries larger jumps first (might reach target faster)
   - Uses early pruning when current path is already worse

Would you like me to:
1. Add more detailed state transitions?
2. Show how it handles different test cases?
3. Explain any specific part in more detail?
4. Compare this with other approaches?

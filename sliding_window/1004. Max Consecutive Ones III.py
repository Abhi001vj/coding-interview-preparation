# Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Max Consecutive Ones III - Comprehensive Analysis
==============================================

Core Concept:
We want to find the longest sequence of consecutive 1s we can create by flipping
at most k zeros. This is effectively a sliding window problem where we're looking
for the longest window that contains at most k zeros.

Let's explore multiple approaches to solve this:
1. Basic Sliding Window 
2. Optimized Sliding Window with Zero Count
3. Prefix Sum with Binary Search

        can't expand (would exceed k zeros) -> start shrinking ->
        [1,1,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [0,0] -> [0] -> []

Key Insights and Patterns:

1. Window Management:
   - Expanding window when valid (zeros â‰¤ k)
   - Shrinking window when invalid (zeros > k)
   - Tracking window state efficiently

2. Optimization Techniques:
   - Using window size vs explicit zero counting
   - Prefix sums for quick range queries
   - Binary search for optimal windows

3. Trade-offs:
   - Time vs Space complexity
   - Code simplicity vs Performance
   - Memory usage vs Computation speed

4. Edge Cases:
   - All zeros
   - All ones
   - k = 0
   - k = length of array

```

The problem can be solved using several approaches, each with its own advantages:

1. **Basic Sliding Window**:
   - Most intuitive approach
   - Easy to understand and implement
   - Good balance of efficiency and simplicity

2. **Optimized Sliding Window**:
   - More efficient state tracking
   - Fewer operations per window adjustment
   - Better space utilization

3. **Prefix Sum**:
   - Different perspective on the problem
   - Enables binary search optimization
   - Better for certain input patterns

Key concepts to understand:
1. Window validity based on zero count
2. Efficient state tracking
3. Optimal window size determination

## üéØ How to Use This Repository

1. **Identify the Pattern**: Based on the problem statement, use the **Pattern Identification Guide** below to determine the relevant coding pattern.
2. **Explore the Pattern**: Go to the **Detailed Pattern Implementations** section to find a reusable code snippet and explanation of the pattern.
3. **Apply and Modify**: Adapt the code to solve specific problems by tweaking parameters or extending the logic as needed.
4. **Practice and Master**: Regularly revisit these patterns with different problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.

## üïµÔ∏è Pattern Identification Guide

This guide will help you identify which pattern is best suited for a problem:

- **Prefix Sum**: Used for subarray sum calculations across multiple queries.
- **Two Pointers**: Best for sorted arrays, often used for finding pairs or reversing operations.
- **Sliding Window**: For problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings with specific criteria.
- **Dynamic Programming**: When a problem has overlapping subproblems and can be divided into simpler, recursive subproblems.
- **Binary Search and Modified Variants**: Ideal for problems involving sorted or rotated arrays.

*(Refer to the **`Detailed Pattern Implementations`** section for a full list and more examples)*

# You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

# Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 105

Jump Game - Comprehensive Analysis

The problem asks us to determine if we can reach the last index by jumping,
where each number represents the maximum jump length from that position.
Let's explore different ways to solve this, starting from simple to optimized
approaches.

Each approach demonstrates different problem-solving strategies:

1. **Recursive (Backtracking)**:
   - Most intuitive but least efficient
   - Tries all possible paths
   - Good for understanding the problem
   - Shows why optimization is needed

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - More efficient than recursion
   - Works backward from the goal
   - Shows optimal substructure
   - Still has room for optimization

3. **Greedy**:
   - Most efficient solution
   - Takes advantage of problem properties
   - Shows how local optimal choices lead to global solution
   - Best for actual implementation

Key Insights:
1. We don't need to find the path, just whether it exists
2. We can work forward (greedy) or backward (DP)
3. At each point, we only need to know if we can reach it

The greedy solution is particularly elegant because:
1. If we can reach position i, we can reach any position up to i
2. We only need to track the furthest position we can reach
3. If we can't reach position i, we can't reach the end

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific approach in more detail?
2. Add more examples or test cases?
3. Show how to handle different variations?

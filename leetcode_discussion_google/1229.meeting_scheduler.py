# Hint
# Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.

# If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an empty array.

# The format of a time slot is an array of two elements [start, end] representing an inclusive time range from start to end.

# It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots [start1, end1] and [start2, end2] of the same person, either start1 > end2 or start2 > end1.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8
# Output: [60,68]
# Example 2:

# Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 12
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 104
# slots1[i].length, slots2[i].length == 2
# slots1[i][0] < slots1[i][1]
# slots2[i][0] < slots2[i][1]
# 0 <= slots1[i][j], slots2[i][j] <= 109
# 1 <= duration <= 106

# Hint 1
# Assume that in the solution, the selected slot from slotsA is bigger than the respectively selected slot from slotsB.
# Hint 2
# Use two pointers in order to try all the possible intersections, and check the length.
# Hint 3
# Do the same in step NÂ° 1 but now assume that the selected slot from slotsB is bigger, return the minimum of the two options.

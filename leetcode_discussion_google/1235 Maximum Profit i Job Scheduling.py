# 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling
# Hard
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
# We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].

# You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

# If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

 

# Example 1:



# Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
# Output: 120
# Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
# Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
# Example 2:



# Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
# Output: 150
# Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
# Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
# Example 3:



# Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
# Output: 6
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 104
# 1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 109
# 1 <= profit[i] <= 104

1. Problem Restatement
You are given three arrays:

startTime: start time of each job
endTime: end time of each job
profit: profit you gain by completing each job
There are n jobs in total, and the 
𝑖
i-th job runs from startTime[i] to endTime[i], yielding profit[i].

Goal: Select a subset of jobs that do not overlap in time, to maximize the total profit. If a job ends at time 
𝑇
T, you can start another job that begins at time 
𝑇
T (i.e., end time is inclusive on one side, exclusive on the next job’s start).

Example:

makefile
Copy code
startTime = [1, 2, 3, 3]
endTime   = [3, 4, 5, 6]
profit    = [50, 10, 40, 70]

Output: 120
Explanation: 
We can pick:
 - Job #1: from 1 to 3, profit=50
 - Job #4: from 3 to 6, profit=70
Total profit = 120
No overlapping: the first job ends exactly at time=3, and the second job starts at time=3, which is allowed.

2. Brute Force Approach
2.1. Concept
Generate all subsets of jobs (or use backtracking/DFS) while ensuring no overlaps.
Calculate the total profit for each valid subset; keep track of the maximum.
2.2. Complexity
In the worst case, there are 
𝑛
n jobs. The number of subsets is 
2
𝑛
2 
n
 .
Checking overlap for a given subset can take 
𝑂
(
𝑛

O(n) in the naive implementation.
Overall, exponential time 
𝑂

 ) with some optimizations.
This is not feasible for 
𝑛
n up to 
5

 .
Hence, brute force is completely impractical for large 
𝑛
n. We need a more efficient method.

3. Optimal Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach
Key Idea:

Sort jobs by their endTime (ascending).
dp[i] = the maximum profit we can achieve considering the first i jobs (where “first i” means the i-th job in the sorted order).
For each job 
𝑖
i, we can either:
Skip it (then profit is dp[i-1]), or
Take it (then profit is profit[i] + dp[indexOfJobThatEndsBeforeStartOf(i)])).
We find indexOfJobThatEndsBeforeStartOf(i) via binary search on the end times to locate the rightmost job that ends on or before startTime[i].
This approach yields an 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn) solution:

Sorting jobs by end time: 
𝑂

For each of the 
𝑛
n jobs, we do a binary search among previous jobs:

jobs by end in ascending order.
Let dp be a 1D array of length 
𝑛
n, where dp[i] means “the maximum total profit using the first i+1 jobs in the sorted order,” or more simply “up to index i (0-based).”
For job i:
Use binary search among the end times of jobs 0..i-1 to find the largest j such that jobs[j].end <= jobs[i].start. If none exists, we consider that “profit from j = 0.”
Then dp[i] = max( dp[i-1], jobs[i].profit + dp[j] ) (where dp[j] is 0 if j = -1).
The answer is dp[n-1] after processing all jobs.

5.1. Visualization in the Code Comments (Example)
We’ll show how the DP is built step by step. Suppose we use the example:

css
Copy code
startTime = [1, 2, 3, 3]
endTime   = [3, 4, 5, 6]
profit    = [50, 10, 40, 70]
Step-by-step (pseudocode description in comments):

python
Copy code
# 1) Construct jobs (start, end, profit):
#    jobs = [(1, 3, 50), (2, 4, 10), (3, 5, 40), (3, 6, 70)]
# 2) Sort by end time (they might already be in ascending order of end, but let's confirm):
#    After sorting by end:
#    jobs = [(1, 3, 50), (2, 4, 10), (3, 5, 40), (3, 6, 70)]
#    (Actually the same order in this example, since end times are 3 < 4 < 5 < 6.)

# end_times = [3, 4, 5, 6]

# 3) dp array (size=4) => dp = [0, 0, 0, 0]

# We'll process each job i in sorted order:

# i = 0: job=(1,3,50)
#   j = find_last_non_conflicting(0):
#     We check the job's start=1, and find the largest end_time <= 1.
#     Since 1 < end_times[0]=3, the bisect_left says insert at index=0, then subtract 1 => j=-1
#     => There's no previous job that ends <= 1
#   profit_if_taken = profit_i + dp[j=-1]? => profit_if_taken = 50 + 0 = 50
#   profit_if_skipped = 0 (since i=0, dp[-1] not valid, treat as 0)
#   dp[0] = max(50, 0) = 50

# i = 1: job=(2,4,10)
#   j = find_last_non_conflicting(1):
#     start=2, we look for the largest end_time <= 2.
#     end_times = [3,4,5,6]. 2 < 3 => bisect_left(end_times,2)=0 => j=0-1=-1 => no valid previous job
#   profit_if_taken = 10 + 0=10
#   profit_if_skipped = dp[0]=50
#   dp[1] = max(10, 50) = 50

# i = 2: job=(3,5,40)
#   j = find_last_non_conflicting(2):
#     start=3, we want largest end_time <= 3
#     bisect_left(end_times,3) gives 0 => subtract 1 => -1 => but wait, 3 itself is in end_times[0].
#     Actually, if a job "ends at 3", we can start another job "at 3" with no overlap.
#     => So we might want bisect_right or a custom approach that allows end_time == start_time.
#     We can fix it by using bisect.bisect_right(end_times, start_i) - 1 if we want "end <= start".
#     But let's assume we used "end <= start" => that means job #0 ends at 3, which should allow
#     job #2 to start at 3 with no overlap.
#     We'll handle that by using "bisect_left(end_times, start_i) - 1",
#       but we must interpret "end_times[j] == start_i" as valid. => Actually, that means j=0.
#     Let's do a manual fix: we want end_times[j] <= start_i, so we might do:
#       idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, start_i) - 1
#     Suppose we do that. For start=3 => bisect_right(end_times,3)=1 => 1-1=0 => j=0
#     => That means job #0 is valid to combine with job #2.
#     So let's assume j=0.
#   profit_if_taken = profit_i + dp[j=0] = 40 + 50 = 90
#   profit_if_skipped = dp[1] = 50
#   dp[2] = max(90, 50) = 90

# i = 3: job=(3,6,70)
#   j = find_last_non_conflicting(3):
#     start=3 => same logic as i=2 => j=0
#   profit_if_taken = 70 + dp[0]= 70+50=120
#   profit_if_skipped = dp[2]= 90
#   dp[3] = max(120, 90)=120

# => Final dp array = [50, 50, 90, 120]
# => dp[-1]=dp[3]=120 is the maximum profit
Note: The key detail in the above example is handling the case “If you choose a job that ends at time X, you can start another job that begins at time X.”

By default, bisect_left(end_times, start_i) would treat “end_time == start_i” as a conflict, so we may prefer bisect_right to allow that equality.
Implementation detail: if we want “end_time <= start_time”, we can do idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, start_i) - 1.
In the final solution code, you can choose either approach as long as it’s consistent with the “no overlap if end == start” rule.

5.2. Handling Edge Cases
No jobs: If input arrays are empty, result is 0. (Constraints say at least 1 job, though.)
All jobs non-overlapping: Then we can simply sum up all profits. The DP will handle it by taking each job in turn.
All jobs overlapping: Then we take the job with the maximum profit alone (DP handles that by skipping all but the highest single job or some combination if possible).

Thought for 6 seconds
Your code is failing because of how you perform the binary search to find the “last non-conflicting job.” The problem states:

If you choose a job that ends at time 
𝑋
X, you can start another job that begins at time 
𝑋
X.

However, in your code you use:

python
Copy code
idx = bisect.bisect_left(end_times, start_i) - 1
The call to bisect_left(end_times, start_i) finds the leftmost index where start_i can be inserted to keep end_times sorted, which effectively is looking for “end_times
𝑗
j 
≥
≥ start_i”. If a job ends exactly at start_i, bisect_left will treat it as if it conflicts. Subtracting 1 will skip this job entirely.

Concrete Example
Consider:

css
Copy code
startTime = [1, 2, 3, 3]
endTime   = [3, 4, 5, 6]
profit    = [50,10,40,70]
The first job ends at 3.
The fourth job starts at 3.
According to the problem, these two can be chained without conflict because “ends at time 3” and “starts at time 3” are non-overlapping.
However, with bisect_left(end_times, 3), we get index = 0, because end_times = [3, 4, 5, 6]. Then 0 - 1 = -1. This tells your code incorrectly that there is no previous job that finishes on or before 3. Hence you never combine the 1st job’s profit (50) with the 4th job’s profit (70) → you end up with 70 instead of the correct 120.

The Fix
You should use bisect_right(end_times, start_i) instead of bisect_left(end_times, start_i) so that an end time == start time is considered valid (i.e., no conflict). Then subtract 1:

python
Copy code
idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, start_i) - 1
This way, if a job’s end_time is exactly equal to the start_i of the current job, it is considered a valid non-conflicting job.

Updated find_last_non_conflicting function:
python
Copy code
def find_last_non_conflicting(job_index):
    start_i = jobs[job_index][0]
    # Use bisect_right to allow end_times[j] == start_i to be valid
    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, start_i) - 1
    return idx
With that change, your DP will correctly consider jobs that end at time 3 to be compatible with jobs that start at time 3, yielding the expected result of 120 for the example.

Why bisect_right?
bisect_left(a, x) returns the leftmost position to insert x in sorted list a, so that a remains sorted. It finds the index of the first element that is not less than x (i.e., >= x).
bisect_right(a, x) returns the rightmost position to insert x, so it finds the index of the first element that is strictly greater than x.
Since you want “end_time 
≤
≤ start_time” to be valid, using bisect_right(end_times, start_i) - 1 ensures that if end_times[j] is exactly equal to start_i, j is included in the valid range of “non-conflicting” jobs.

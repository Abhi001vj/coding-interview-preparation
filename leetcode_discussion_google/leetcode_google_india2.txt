This was asked in Google Interview.


Given a list of parent-child relationships, build a tree out of it.


Example Input:


80 19
50 20
20 15
80 16
50 80
20 17


You should return the following tree:


         50
        /  \
      20    80
     / \    / \
    15 17  19 16
PS: This doesn't have to be a binary tree. You need to return a root node.

I would iterate the data and create TreeNode element per pair. (append child to parent). I would save a hashmap with key of parent value (i.e. 80) and value of reference to TreeNode.
Per TreeNode I build or child I append, I first check if that element is already built in the hashmap and use the reference. Otherwise, I create ad-hoc.

Topological ordering can also be considered, root node indegree would be 0 , so take that first and from there on standar6 Kahn algorithm.

With Easy explanation of code in Python


class Node:
def init(self, value):
self.value = value
self.children = []


def build_tree(relationships):
node_map = {}
root = None


# Step 1: Create nodes for all parent-child relationships
for parent, child in relationships:
    if parent not in node_map:
        node_map[parent] = Node(parent)
    if child not in node_map:
        node_map[child] = Node(child)
    
    parent_node = node_map[parent]
    child_node = node_map[child]
    
    parent_node.children.append(child_node)
    
    # If this is the root node (first pair in the input), set it as the root
    if root is None:
        root = parent_node

return root
Example Input relationships
relationships = [
(80, 19),
(50, 20),
(20, 15),
(80, 16),
(50, 80),
(20, 17)
]


Build the tree
root_node = build_tree(relationships)


Function to print the tree using depth-first traversal
def print_tree(node, level=0):
if node:
print(' ' * level + str(node.value))
for child in node.children:
print_tree(child, level + 1)


Print the tree
print_tree(root_node)

Store par-child relation nodes in a hash map.
For finding root node, choose any node and go onto top until you cannot find its parent and return it.

Iterate over all pairs, get/create node for parent and children and assign child to the parent.. Also add parent and child nodes to a hashmap (so you won't make node next time val comes
generate a list of parents and a set of children. Then iterate over all parents, if it's not in the children set then it is the root -- return it.
This would talk o(n) space and time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

This sounds like building a graph using the given vertices and then constructing/ assuming the graph itself as a tree. Correct me if I am wrong!

Replace string variable with it's value for printf function.
String would contain only "%d" and the values following that will be only integers. Lets say for simplicity input will be a string and array of integers, which can be parsed from the printf statement.
Ex. printf("hi %d.", 1)
should result in: hi 1.


Follow up:
What happens for multiple type; i.e., if the string contains "%d" and "%f".
printf("hi %d %f.", 1,2.9)

If there are multiple %d present in the string, how does the value as an input look like?


printf("hi %d %d", 1,1)
Like this? Or it is an array of values?
Also, input type is defined? Just numbers, or strings, or anything?

Would the solution for this essentially be to just linearly scan the input, and if you come across a '%d', just take the next indexed value from the array input? Or am I missing something here?


def printf_string_parse(input_string, arr):
    output = ""
    arr_index = 0
    str_index = 0
    while str_index < len(input_string):
        if input_string[str_index] == "%" and input_string[str_index+1] == "d":
            if arr_index < len(arr):
                output += str(arr[arr_index])
                arr_index += 1
                str_index += 2
            else:
                raise IndexError( "Input string contains more '%d' markers than there are variables to print" )
        else:
            output += input_string[str_index]
            str_index += 1

    return output

Question
We are given a list of Employees with their ID, manager ID, and Name. The question ask us to print the names of all the employees in a hierarchy.
Note: [The Ultimate manager is the one with the highest ID Value and whose ID is same as the Manager ID]


List of Employees INPUT:-


    { id: 8, managerId: 8, name: "Alice" },
    { id: 2, managerId: 8, name: "Bob" },
    { id: 3, managerId: 2, name: "Emp3" },
    { id: 4, managerId: 3, name: "Emp4" },
    { id: 5, managerId: 4, name: "Emp5" },
    { id: 6, managerId: 3, name: "Emp6" },
    { id: 7, managerId: 8, name: "Emp7" },
];
Output:-


// ---Bob
// ------Emp3
// ---------Emp4
// ------------Emp5
// ---------Emp6
// ---Emp7
Solution:-
class Employee;

class Solution
{
public:
	static void printPrettyNames(vector<Employee*> &employees);

	static void dfsPrint(Employee *emp, int indent);
};

//Creating The Skeleton Of The System.
class Employee
{
   public:
   int id = 0;		//id -> Current Employee's ID.
   int managerID = 0;		//managerID -> Manager's ID Of The Current Employee.
   string name;		//Name Of The Current Employee.
   vector<Employee*> team;		//Team Of (Sub-Ordinates/Other Employees) Under The Current Employee.

   Employee(int id, int managerId, const string &name);		//Creating a Constructor To Initialize The Values Given By The User.

};

void Solution::printPrettyNames(vector<Employee*> &employees)
{
  unordered_map<int, Employee*> idToEmployee;		//Creating A Map To Link an Employee With Other Associated Employees.
  int maxId = -1;		//maxId Will Store The ID Of The Ultimate Manager.

  for (auto e : employees)		//Traversing Through All The Employees.
  {
	  idToEmployee[e->id] = e;		//Linking Employee IDs.

	  if (e->id == e->managerID)		//If The Employee ID Is Same As The Manager ID, Chances Are It Is The Ultimate Manager.
	  {
		 maxId = max(maxId, e->id);		//Keep Track Of The Ultimate Manager.
	  }

	  else		//If The Employee ID Is Not Same As The Manager ID, We Will Link The Current Employee With It's Manager.
	  {
		  if (idToEmployee.find(e->managerID) != idToEmployee.end())
		  {
			  idToEmployee[e->managerID]->team.push_back(e);		//Pushing The Employee Into It's Manager's Team.
		  }
	  }
  }

  Employee *highest = idToEmployee[maxId];		//*highest Will Be Pointing To The Ultimate Manager.
  dfsPrint(highest,0);		//Calling A Recursive Function To Print The Ultimate Manager And It's Sub-Ordinates In A Hierarchy, With An Indentation For Better Look.


}

void Solution::dfsPrint(Employee *emp, int indent)
{
	if (emp == nullptr)		//If emp is Pointing To A nullptr i.e, If No Employee Exist In A Parent Employee's Team, Just Return.
	{
	   return;
	}

	cout << emp->name.indent(indent) << std::endl;		//Else, Print The Current Employee's Name With An Indentation.

	for (auto e : *emp->team)		//Traverse Through The Current Employee's Team And Again Do A Recrusive Call With An Indentation Of 3 For Better Look.
	{
		dfsPrint(e,indent + 3);
	}

}

Employee::Employee(int id, int managerId, const string &name)
{
	this->id = id;
	this->managerID = managerId;
	this->name = name;
	team = vector<Employee>();

I have applied for embedded developer role. Below question asked in 45 minutes Phone interview.


Question 1:
Implement a software router. The hardware includes:


A general purpose computer (a CPU + some RAM)


M Input ports and N output ports, where each port can hold 32 bits of data.


Protocol:
Router receives and sends "Messages", where each message consists of 2 packets of 32 bits (data0, data1)


Each input port can receive multiple messages and receive them back to back. Each message needs to be sent out
to the correct destination port. Ports may take time to consume these messages.


Message API: 
int get_dest_port_id(uint32 data0); // Call this on first packet of a message to decode the destination port id.


Both packets of a Message must be received from input port and forwarded to output port in correct order.


Port API: 
bool input_ready(int port_id); // 32 bits of data is ready to pop. 
bool output_ready(int port_id); // Port is empty, and can accept 32 bits of data. 
uint32 pop_input(int port_id); // Ensure input ready before calling this. 
void push_output(int port_id, uint32 data); // Ensure output ready before calling this.


Task is to implement the router entry point that continuously processes messages.


Question 2:


Write a function that sets the given value into specified bit(s) in a 32-bit integer. All bits outside
of start and end bits should remain unmodified.


unsigned int setbits (unsigned int input, unsigned int value, int startbit, int endbit);


Example:


input: 0b1010111111, value: 0b01, startbit: 2, endbit: 5
output 0b1010.0001.11


0b1010111111
2 - 5
0001
0001 11


0b1010 0001 11

            //reset the state to 0 as the packet is transferred
            dataState[i] = 0;

    i = i%M;

Thanks for sharing the questions. For the first one, is the system expected to receive the packet in order , meaning data0 from one input port is always followed by data1 from the same input port ? Or could it be random? Since getting the port ID would be one of the important steps here , is there an interrupt generated when there is a message received on the port ?
Trying to understand the question.
Would you mind sharing what was your approach here?

Phone Interview:


There is a grasshopper that starts from the root node, if the hopper hops to a node with no children the hopper is stuck and can't move further. If the grasshopper has the option to move then it has to make the hop. Basically the goal is to find the probability of the grasshopper landing at each node.

You are starting at first building. You have b (no of bricks) and r(no. of ropes). You can only move by 1 building at a time. To move to the next building,
If next building height is less or equal you can move without using any resource(bricks/ropes).
If next building height is greater you can either use bricks (1 brick for 1 unit of height) or a rope(you can climb any height using rope).
(https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/528584/Google-or-Onsite-or-How-Far-Can-We-Reach-using-Rope-and-Bricks/465758)
find the maximum distance you can cover using given array, b and r.


Round 3
Q1: Given an array of N distinct unsorted integers. Return a list of numbers which can be found in the array using binary search.
Ex: If the array is [4, 3, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7] answer: 3, 5, 8, 10
(https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/352743/Google-or-Onsite-or-Guaranteed-Binary-Search-Numbers)
Followup
how to prevent dynamic growing of arrayList which is storing result?


Round 4
There is a country that has multiple cities, and for simplicity each city has a 3-letter name. Some pairs of cities are connected with roads. Example:
Your friend recently took a trip around some of that country's cities. You ask them what their itinerary was, and they say: "I went to AAA, BBB, CCC, DDD in that order."


You quickly realize your friend must have misremembered, as this itinerary is impossible. BBB is not connected to CCC, and DDD doesn't exist. But, with a two-letter change, you can make a valid itinerary: AAA, XBB, CCC, DDY so you guess that was your friend's actual itinerary. You could also consider AAA, BBB, GOO, DDY, but that requires 4 letters to change so it's not as good of a guess.


Minimise the cost to validate the itenerary.


Round 5 (Googlyness)
Tell something about a project that you are satisfied with/and proud of.
Tell about an instance where you faced interpersonal problems with people around you.
Tell about an experience when you have worked with a non performer in your team and how you helped them.
Tell about the problem where you faced challenges in working with them as peer.

Binary search is a search algorithm usually used on a sorted sequence to quickly find an element with a given value. In this problem we will evaluate how binary search performs on data that isn't necessarily sorted. An element is said to be binary searchable if, regardless of how the pivot is chosen the algorithm returns true. For example:


[2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5] and target = 5, we cannot find 5. Because when the pivot is 4, we get element 6, then right pointer will move left, so we'll lose the opportunity to find target 5.
[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6] and target = 5, we can find 5. Because wherever we choose the pivots, we'll find target at last.
Given an unsorted array of n distinct integers, return the number of elements that are binary searchable.


Example 1:


Input: [1, 3, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: However we choose the pivots, we will always find the number 1 when looking for it. This does not hold for 3 and 2.
Example 2:


Input: [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 and 6 are the numbers guaranteed to be found.
Example 3:


Input: [1, 5, 7, 11, 12, 18]
Output: 6
Explanation: All elements in a sorted sequence are binary searchable.
Example 4:


Input: [3, 2, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No numbers guaranteed to be found.
Example 5:


Input: [5, 4, 6, 2, 8]
Output: 1
Explanation: Only 8 is guaranteed to be found.
Example 6:


Input: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8]
Output: 4
The same problem on Topcoder.


Solution
In other words, the problems asks how many elements are larger than all elements to their left, and smaller than all elements to their right.

Given a zero-inexed array H of height of buildings, number of bricks b and number of ropes r. You start your journey from buiding 0 and move to adjacent building either using rope or bricks. You have limited number of bricks and ropes.
While moving from ith building to (i+1)th building,


if next building's height is less than or equal to the current buiding's height, you do not need rope or bricks.
if next building's height is greater than current buiding's height, you can either use one rope or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
So, question is How far can you reach from 0th buiding if you use bricks and ropes optimally? return index of building till which you can move.


Example 1:


Input : H = [4,2,7,6,9,11,14,12,8], b = 5, r = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: use rope to move from index 1 to index 2. 
use 3 bricks to move from index 3 to index 4. 
use 2 bricks to move from index 4 to index 5. 
use rope to move from index 5 to index 6. 
so we can reach at the end of the array using 2 ropes and 5 bricks. 
Example 2:


Input : H = [4,2,7,6,9,11,14,12,8], b = 5, r = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: use rope to move from index 1 to index 2. 
use 3 bricks to move from index 3 to index 4. 
use 2 bricks to move from index 4 to index 5. 
so we can reach at index 5 using 1 ropes and 5 bricks.

Given a tree of the organizational structure, let's say a company like "Google" .
Also mentioned that the root is always Engineer.


class Employee {
int employeeId;
boolean isEngineer;
List reportees;
}


Given a tree


							E1
			________________|________________
			|               |               | 
		   E2              NE1             E3
		___|___             |               
		|     |             |               
		E4    NE2           E5 
Convert this graph to Engineer only graph.


							E1
			________________|________________
			|               |               | 
		   E2              E5               E3
		   |                                                       
		   E4               
In the above figure, E represents Engineers and NE represents Non-Engineers.
He also asked me to modify code at the end, also gave me an option to use a new graph or to modify the current graph.
I used a new graph, he seemed convinced .

Given a table of rules, write a function to check if it contains conflicting rules. Two rules are conflicting if their conditions match but values do not. Conditions can contain don't cares denoted by '-'. Has to be done in O(n) time.


e.g
Rule Conditions Value
R1 C1,C2,C3 40
R2 BCD1,BC5 40
R3 BCD1,BC5 80
Here, R2 and R3 conflict.
e.g
R1 C1,C2,C3 40
R2 BCD1,BC5 50
R3 BCD1,- 50
R6 -,-,C3 40
No conflicts.

At each node of trie also store the number of unique values exceeds one for its children or not and if it does not then store the value. In case of "-" in the string, the node which you reach for first occurrence of it will tell you if it is conflicting or not.


The question is then how to build such a value. We need to implement DFS like traversal for adding a value in trie. Whenever we backtrack we update the precomputed values of the node.

One insight here is that the rules with higher number of don't cares need to be processed before the well-formed rules (of the same length). That's because we need to put a restriction on the well-formed rules after it that might satisfy it.
We should process separate length rules in separate iterations, initialising a trie for each iteration (different length rules are not going to conflict anyway). Even when processing the rules of same length, we need to ensure the higher don't cares go into the trie first so we'll have to sort by the number of don't cares.
We do two pass for each rule. First pass is validating the contents of the rule against existing contents. Second pass is insertion into the trie if needed.
I tried to come up with a solution that wouldn't utilise sorting but I'm not able to process the strings in linear fashion then.
OP can you rename the post title to Google | Intern | Conflicting Rules. More people will read your post and be able to help out.

Given a sorted n-size array, there are k elements have been changed i.e. [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 12] (it might be changed from [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12] with k = 2). Important to know is that k is unknown and k is much smaller than n. The task is to re-sort the entire array.
The interviewer wants O(n) solution. I bombed this one. In the end, the interviewer kind of fed the solution to me. What he suggested: a. break the array into two: one sorted array and one unsorted array e.g. [1, 3, 5, 12] and [6, 4, 2]. This takes O(n) b. Sort the unsorted array. This takes O(klogk) c. Merge two sorted arrays. This takes O(n). Because k is very small, so in the end O(n) + O(klogk) ~= O(n).
Does this solution make sense to you ? In O(n) how can we split array into sorted and unsorted with unsorted arry being of size k?

I found this stack overflow link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62764861/how-to-sort-an-array-with-n-elements-in-which-k-elements-are-out-of-place-in-on which summarises the solution:


Find elements which are not sorted by traversing the array.
If an element was found which is larger than the next one, then either it or the following one are out of order (or both).
Keep both of them aside, and remove them from the array.
Continue traversing on the newly obtained array (after removal), from the index which comes before the found element.
This will put aside 2k elements in O(n) time.
Sort 2k elements O(klogk)
Merge two sorted lists which have total n elements, O(n)
Total O(n + klogk)
For the above array, the resulting arrays will be - [1, 3, 12] and [5, 6, 4, 2] ( 2k elements ). I think the above will give O(n) in worst case if (k << n).

One way to solve is to convert this into 23. Merge k Sorted Lists.


Example: [[1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2, 12]] can be split into 3 sorted lists, i.e. [[1,3,5,6],[4],[2,12]]
The running complexity will be O(nlogk) though. Given k is much smaller than n, can it be considered almost linear?

Here is a python solution. Basic idea is we take first element of arr and store it in a sorted list and keep track of all unsorted elements in a separate array. Sort the second, and merge them together. Thought worst case would be nlogn if the max and min were the first two elements such as [14,1,4,5,2,3,10]


arr = [1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 10, 12]

def merge(arr):
    first = [arr[0]] # creates a sorted array starting from the first index
    second = [] # keeps track of any elements that are out of order
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < first[-1]: second.append(arr[i])
        else: first.append(arr[i])

    second.sort() #klogk
    res = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    # merge total of N elements
    while i < len(first) and j < len(second):
        if first[i] < second[j]:
            res.append(first[i])
            i += 1            
        else:
            res.append(second[j])
            j += 1            

    res.extend(first[i:len(first)])
    res.extend(second[j:len(second)])

    return res

k is much smaller is somewhat vague, if N=10^8, you can say that k=10^4 is much smaller, yet you cannot really claim that O(N) + O(k log k) ~= O(N)
If k is very small, did you mention that insertion sort has time complexity of ~O(N) in a nearly sorted array? I can only imagine that splitting has space complexity of O(N) where insertion sort doesn't need any additional space

Move your pointer from the left until u see a dip(valley instead of a non decreasing order)
This is the start index of the un sorted array
Also note the last number that was in the right place (6 in your above example)
Now walk from the left until u see
a. Either a value that's increasing OR
b. A value that is smaller than the stored element in 3.
This is the end index of the unsorted array
Pull that out . Sort it in klogk
Then go ahead and merge 2 sorted lists in o(n)

Google | SDE - Backend | Bengaluru | May 2021 [Reject]


Status: 2 YOE
Position: SDE at a midsize company
Location: Bengaluru, India


How I got the interview?
I reached out to a recruiter who had posted on linkedin that google was looking for backend developers. I sent the recruiter a cold email with my resume. I was almost certain this was a waste of time as most of the recruiters who I had sent such mails never replied back. But, this recruiter did. The recruiter set up a 30 min call just to know my background. We had a good talk about the projects im currently working on and about my experiences. After the call my phone screen was set up. They gave me suffeciant time to prepare. Truly, Google recruiters are a class apart. They gave me study material etc.


Phone Screen (2 weeks after the Recruiter Call): 45 mins


The inter viewer and I had a brief discussion for about 5 mins about my background and then we dove right into the porblem statement. It was a medium/hard string search and manipulation problem. Came up with a solution within 15 min. Wrote the code in the next 10 mins and ran one dry test case. The interviewer was very poker faced and didnt give out much. The question is going to be ambigous. Always discuss with the interviewer. Tell the interviewer whatever you are thinking. Google has their own interview notepad++ kind of thing and they dont use google docs anymore but its very similar. Just syntax highlighting will be there.


After a week of anxiety I got a call from my recruiter that I had cleared the phone screen round. I was super joyed. I was given another 2 weeks to prepare for the virtual onsite interview. They scheduled only 2 rounds of the onsite and said only if I cleared this the next 2 rounds would be unlocked.


Virtual On-site: 45 mins each
Round 1: The interviewer was little grumpy and dove straight into the question. It was 90% math problem and 10% DS/Algo problem. Question was related to changing probabilty based on an event occuring or not. And with each event occuring the probabilty of the event happening will change based on the circumstances in which it occured. So given a list of such events I needed to find the final probability of the event occuring.
By the time I recollected all the probabilty I learnt in high school and Pre University, half the time was up. The interviewer did help a little but still I was very blank. I started to freak out. By the time I orally solved the problem there was only 10 mins left. I could not complete the code. The interviewer just said that he got where I was going with the code and ended the interview.


Round 2: This interviewer was smiling and seemed like a nice person. She introduced herself and then we dove into the problem. She even explained the problem statement. It was more or less related to the card game SET, with a little variation. After going about the brute force way, I found a more optimal solution and she was happy with it. She asked me to code the solution I came up with. It took me 5 mins to write the code. She asked me a follow up question. It was on lines of what if a joker card was introduced the cards. It was a pretty simple variation. I told her the solution and she told me to make changes to the code. I did and the interview time was almost up. After that it was justa bunch of chit chatting and the the interview was done.


2 days later I got the call from the recruiter saying they are not moving forward with my profile. I honestly was expecting another round of interviews as my 2nd round went considerabaly well but sadly I didnt get any. I will update this post on the feedback I receive from the recruiter.


Preperation for me was just leetcode. I bought leetcode premium a while ago and I completed the google track. Dont let the tag of google scare you, it is honestly simpler than you think. Anyways will keep trying, on to more leetcoding.


PS: yes leetcode premium is worth it if you are seriously thinking of interviewing or if you have interviews lined up. If its is just pre job-applying interview prep then no need of premium.

I have given Google Online Coding Challenge recently. There were 2 questions


First one was largest element from here: https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/887761/google-swe-intern-oa-sea (20 points)
https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/889942/any-idea-how-to-solve-this-problem-i-just-bombed-it-in-an-interview (30 points)
10 on 10 testcases passed for first, only 5 on 10 passed for second.
Should I expect a call for further rounds ?


UPDATE 1: Got the call for further rounds !


UPDATE 2: I had following rounds till now:


Telephonic screen
Onsite 1 coding
Onsite 2 coding
Onsite 3 coding
Onsite 4 googleyness
Onsite 5 coding


2 FIT calls
The feedback for 2 rounds out of 5 onsite was borderline. So, recruiter got statement of support from manager. Waiting for further update from recuiter.

Hi all,


Sharing the two questions I encountered during my SWE Intern OA, platform was on HackerRank and time limit is 60 minutes for 2 questions. Was able to solve the first one but didn't have sufficient time for the second time (not sure whether I was correct as well), will be glad if anyone can give some hint regarding q2.


(1) The Largest Element


We are supposed to find out absolute difference of these distinct values, and since the absolute difference must be within the range of min(arr) and max(arr). If we want to retrieve the Kth largest element, we can do max(arr)-K if K is less than max(arr).


image


(2) Minimum Cost Connections
Didn't have enough time to figure out the solution (I'm not too good at solving graph/dp questions also), was trying to do backtracking but probably will get TLE as well, felt like I've seen this question somewhere before but still wasn't able to solve it. Would be great if someone can give me some directions for this question.


image


Input follows the input format.
5
12 7 8 24 2 7
6 5 12 4 8 7
5
1 2
2 3
4 2
5 4


Ans: (7+6)[From City 6 to City 1] + (7+8)[From City 6 to City 5] = 13 + 15 = 28

Fast solution of Q1, doing only n times a gcd call. Observe that in the final array the minimal integer what we can get is the gcd of all numbers. If that is g=gcd(v[0],v[1],..v[n-1]) and the maximal number is m in the input vector then all numbers will be m-t*g in the final array, where t>=0 integer, hence the answer is just m-(K-1)*g if and only if it is positive.


class Solution{
    
public:
    
    int gcd(int x,int y){
        return y==0?x:gcd(y,x%y);
    }
    
    int solve(vector<int> v,int K){
        
        int g=v[0];
        int m=v[0];
        for(int x:v){
            g=gcd(g,x);
            m=max(m,x);
        }
        
        // ans=m-(K-1)*g>0
        long ans=m;
        ans-=(long) (K-1)*g;
        return (ans>0?ans:-1);
    }
};

int main(void){
    
    Solution *s=new Solution;
    cout<<s->solve({1,3,5,6,7},2)<<endl;
    cout<<s->solve({1},2)<<endl;
    cout<<s->solve({1,3,5,6,7},6)<<endl;
    
    return 0;
}

The solution of Q2 (only the algorithm), to solve it in linear time, so in O(V+E).
the drawn pictures: https://imgur.com/a/DHl7qZ3
case1.
First suppose that in G there is no directed cycle:
In that case let u[1],u[2],...,u[k] the vertices from 1..N with income degree=0. Since we have to reach them
we surely need to use (at least) k new added edges that ends in these points, the (income) cost of these is
s2=cost2[u[1]]+cost2[u[2]]+...+cost2[u[k]].
Then let t that point from the cost is the smallest, so t=argmin(cost1[1],cost1[2],...,cost1[N+1]).
If t=N+1, then bingo, the answer is s2+k*cost1[N+1], so add the (N+1,u[i]) edges to the graph. (see first picture)
Else, so if t<=N, then let t reachable from u[p], then add (N+1,u[p]) to the graph and
(t,u[i]) for all i!=p, the total cost of this is s2+cost1[N+1]+(k-1)*cost1[t]. (see 2nd pic)


case2.
There are directed cycles in the graph. Good, detect them and contract it with the following way:
if v[1],...,v[k] is in a strongly connected component (SCC), then replace the whole component with a single P point. And update cost1[P]=min(cost1[v[1]],cost1[v[2]],..,cost1[v[k]]), and cost2[P]=min(cost2[v[1]],cost2[v[2]],...,cost2[v[k]]). At the end there will be no directed cycle in the graph, hence you can apply case1. (see 3rd pic)

Shouldn't the answer for the given example of Q2 be 23, instead of 28?


Since our aim is to connect city 6 to all the remaining cities (i.e 1 to 5), we can first have a directed edge from city 6 to city 5, and then a directed edge from city 5 to city 1, instead of a directed edge from city 6 to city 1 (as done in the example).


So, the actual cost will be ->
cost of outward edge from city 6, which is equal to 7
cost of inward edge to city 5, which is equal to 8
cost of outward edge from city 5, which is equal to 2
cost of inward edge to city 1, which is equal to 6


net sum of all cost = 7+8+2+6 = 23

Solution for Q1
We only need kth largest element
So lets assume we have k<n-1
So we need to take the max element say 7 in this case and get k-1 largest element
k-1 can only be produced by the difference of max element and k-1 th min element of that round here 1st min which is 1
hence max-min = 7-1=6 is the answer

For the second problem.
Algorithm:-


Get the strongly connected components of the graph.
Compress the graph, one node as one component.
3.Calculate the min_cost of making an edge. i.e. iterate over all the nodes in one component.
Do step 3 for all the components.
This should prolly give you the answer.

Trying to understand what the second questions is asking, because it seems like you just need to pick the lowest cost road TO and road FROM N that connects N to any of (1->N-1).

You have n items, cost is c(i) and delivery cost is d(i). If customer orders more than one item, then they get it for the minimum delivery cost. How do you find the maximum amount of money you can make after delivering m items? I know this is a knapsack problem, but I just can't find a way to solve it. And I want to make sure I am able to solve these problems for future interviews.


For e.g.
cost and delivery cost respectively (first column being cost, second being delivery cost):
Item 1: 7, 10
Item 2: 4, 15
Item3: 8, 1


m = 2


Input format (java): int n, int m, int[][] arr where n is the total number of items, m is the maximum number of items you can deliver, arr has each row with first element being cost, second being delivery cost.


Output: 31 (You choose the first two items because if you chose the 3rd item, the delivery cost for 2 items would be 1 + 1 (since 1 is the mimimum delivery cost) so you would end up with 23 + 2 = 25.

Both these questions were asked to me in one of the onsite rounds for the Google SWE role.


Q1: Given some source code and a set of keyword substitutions, return the source code after performing all the substitutions. In other words, all occurences of a keyword X should be substituted by another keyword Y and multiple such pairs are provided.
A1: This was a straightforward coding question; the interviewer was focused on code correctness and edge case handling and not on algorithmic complexity.


Q2: A very similar question to this: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/


Personal Experience: Managed to solve both the questions however the interviewer had to point some edge case misses for the first one.


Advice: Get into the habit of double checking your code as you're writing it and DO NOT give any opportunity for the interviewer to point out bugs/mistakes because this can mean the difference between a good hire and a weak hire.

The interview was of 40 minutes and asked the below two questions.


Flip a given byte array containing monochrome bit values of an image.
You are given a single dimensional byte array, width and height.
Here they wanted me to consider a 2D image saved in an single dimension array. Using the given width and height, we can actually consider the 1D array as a combination of multiple rows of an 2D array ( image ). I wrote a function to flip it with that particular logic. The interviewer was happy with the answer, but he also asked me to consider the minute details such as "monochrome image" and I will have to also flip the granular bits in the byte array. I was not familiar with bit and byte manipulation, hence we moved to another question.


An easy question, find the shortest path from (0, 0) to (m-1, n-1) of a 2 D matrix filled with 1's and 0's. You can travel through a 0 and not a 1.
Update to question: After I solved this question, he modifed the question by a bit. He told me to find the shortest possible path by flipping a single '1'. i.e, You can at max flip a single '1', and that should give me the minimum shortest distance. I couldn't crack that in the remaining time left.

For the follow up to the second question:


Use standard BFS solution tracking the following (cur_distance, cur_pos, number_of_1s_flipped).
At every position, if it's possible to reach the unvisited neighbours without number_of_1s_flipped exceeding 1, push them in the queue.
If we reach the destination, return the cur_distance.

I recently interviewed for google L4 India. I got following feedbacks:


Round 1 (telephonic): Hire
Round 2: Strong hire
Round 3: Weak unhire
Round 4 (googlyness): strong hire
Round 5: Weak hire


what are my chances to get the L4 role?


UPDATE:


lot of people asking me the interview questions. I ll say among all interviews I gave google ll ask the easiest questions. You need to focus on getting code correct in one shot. If you are able to do that you are selected. Hardest round will be round 1 which is telephonic round. If you get rejected there then not a problem you can re-apply. If you are rejected in onsite then you loose one chance out of 3. But telephonic rounds are easy. To me they asked:


telephonic:
find lowest comman weight path between 2 nodes in a tree. Simply a modification of LCA.


Onsite 1:
find number of islands in a matrix with 0 and 1.
Followup:
https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192
strong hire feedback here. Was able to solve and implement both of the questions in 40 mins. 5 mins still remaining.


Onsite 2:
probably easiest yet I got paniced and messed this one. Split a given string based on space. Next part was to split it based on space but exclude spaces that are preceeded by "". That is if input is: "I love leet\ code" output ll be {"I", "love", "leet code"}. Basically you need to come with test cases in this problem. i missed cases like "I love \\ leetcode". The problem was more on forming test cases.


Onsite 3:
Probably the hardest question that was asked yet not too hard. Was able to clear that but code missed some test cases. I was able to cover those in next 30 seconds but feedback got lean hire since code that I gave did not work in one go. So lot of nit picks. (i wont type the question since it is too long to type and I am too lazy).


My takes:


google isnt hard except telephonic.
Calmness while solving is the key. Solving mid level questions on LC ll do the job.
Luck has a greater role to play here.
The interviews are unfair, they test requirement gathering and all just with single question. That too in 45 minutes. Expect no hints. If you are taking then don't expect selection.
The videos on google interview saying that we ask brute force and then optimize is totally wrong. The videos that say google looks for approach are also wrong. You have to solve question in 45 minutes and the code that you wrote should be correct in one go. If not then you are out.
Prefer C++ or python over Java. If you use java type really fast.
You may say that no it is not the case, then I ll say cross check by giving the interview and tell me in comments.

Sophie gives a list of numbers to her five-year-old daughter and explains four types of operations that she can perform on this list. Sophie also gives her a list that shows the sequence in which these operations can be performed. Each operation is performed on the output of the previous operation.


Operation 1: Add a value V to all the numbers in the list from index X to Y.
Operation 2: Subtract the value V from all the numbers in the list from index X to Y.
Operation 3: Initialize all the numbers in the list from index X to Y with the value V.
Operation 4: Find the sum of all the values in the list from index X to Y and add that sum to all the elements in the list.


Write an algorithm to help Sophie’s daughter perform the operations and output the final li st of numbers.


Input
The first line of the input consists of two space-separated integers - N and P representing the size of the list provided by Sophie and the number of operations to be performed on the list, respectively.
The second line consists of N space-separated integers - num1, num2, ..., numN , representing the numbers of the list provided by Sophie.
The next P lines consist of four space-separated integers - op, X, Y and V, representing the type of operation; the start and end index of the range of numbers on which the operations must be performed; and the value that will be used to perform the operation, respectively.


Output
Print N space-separated integers representing the final list after performing all the operations.


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ P ≤ 105
1 ≤ V ≤ 105 , if op != 4
V = 0 , if op = 4
-105 ≤ numi ≤ 105
1 ≤ i ≤ N


Note
As the output of an operation on the number of the list can be very large, modulo it by 1000000007.


Example
Input:
6 5
20 13 4 5 8 10

Sophie gives a list of numbers to her five-year-old daughter and explains four types of operations that she can perform on this list. Sophie also gives her a list that shows the sequence in which these operations can be performed. Each operation is performed on the output of the previous operation.


Operation 1: Add a value V to all the numbers in the list from index X to Y.
Operation 2: Subtract the value V from all the numbers in the list from index X to Y.
Operation 3: Initialize all the numbers in the list from index X to Y with the value V.
Operation 4: Find the sum of all the values in the list from index X to Y and add that sum to all the elements in the list.


Write an algorithm to help Sophie’s daughter perform the operations and output the final li st of numbers.


Input
The first line of the input consists of two space-separated integers - N and P representing the size of the list provided by Sophie and the number of operations to be performed on the list, respectively.
The second line consists of N space-separated integers - num1, num2, ..., numN , representing the numbers of the list provided by Sophie.
The next P lines consist of four space-separated integers - op, X, Y and V, representing the type of operation; the start and end index of the range of numbers on which the operations must be performed; and the value that will be used to perform the operation, respectively.


Output
Print N space-separated integers representing the final list after performing all the operations.


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ P ≤ 105
1 ≤ V ≤ 105 , if op != 4
V = 0 , if op = 4
-105 ≤ numi ≤ 105
1 ≤ i ≤ N


Note
As the output of an operation on the number of the list can be very large, modulo it by 1000000007.


Example
Input:
6 5
20 13 4 5 8 10
1 2 3 2
3 1 4 1
2 5 6 5
4 1 6 0
3 2 4 2


Output:
13 2 2 2 15 17


Explanation:
The input list = 20 13 4 5 8 10.
After the first operation, the list is 20 15 6 5 8 10.
After the second operation, the list is 1 1 1 1 8 10.
After the third operation, the list is 1 1 1 1 3 5.
After the fourth operation, the list is 13 13 13 13 15 17.
After the fifth operation, the final list is 13 2 2 2 15 17.

Given a list of k sorted iterators. Implement MergingIterator to merge them. If you are not familiar with Iterators check similar questions.


class MergingIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
	public MergingIterator(List<Iterator<Integer>> iterators) {
	}

	public boolean hasNext() {
	}

	public Integer next() {
	}
}
Example:


MergingIterator itr = new MergingIterator([[2, 5, 9], [], [4, 10]]);
itr.hasNext(); // true
itr.next(); // 2
itr.next(); // 4
itr.next(); // 5
itr.next(); // 9
itr.next(); // 10
itr.hasNext(); // false
itr.next(); // error

Standard PQ solution for merging K sorted lists, clean.


constructor - O(K*logK) - where K - number of lists(iterators)
hasNext() - O(1) speed
next() - O(logK) - where K - number of lists(iterators)


Space O(n), map and queue for storing iterators.


class MergingIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {

    private final Map<Iterator<Integer>, Integer> curMap;
    private final Queue<Iterator<Integer>> iteratorQueue;

    public MergingIterator(List<Iterator<Integer>> iterators) {
        this.curMap = new HashMap<>();
        this.iteratorQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(this.curMap::get));
        for (Iterator<Integer> iter : iterators) {
            if (iter.hasNext()) {
                curMap.put(iter, iter.next());
                this.iteratorQueue.add(iter);
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return !iteratorQueue.isEmpty();
    }

    public Integer next() {
        if (iteratorQueue.isEmpty()) {
            throw new NoSuchElementException("Iterator is empty");
        }

        Iterator<Integer> iter = iteratorQueue.poll();

        Integer res = curMap.get(iter);

        if (iter.hasNext()) {
            curMap.put(iter, iter.next());
            iteratorQueue.add(iter);
        }

        return res;

Put iterators in a min heap and advance them, removing them when they equals the ends of their vecs (I'd use pairs in the heap).

I come up with multiple approaches;
Have a look


Using Priority Queue and Iterator,value as item in Queue

/**
 * This approach take the advantage of keeping iterator and the next value for this iterator in
 * Priority queue it self.
 * <p>
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Initially we'll push all non-empty iterator first value and iterator (after taking first value) in priority queue as pair
 * 2. For next, we'll poll the top Pair and gets its value, then check does this "poll" iterator has more entry to give.
 * If yes, fetch next entry form this iterator, put a new entry in Priority Queue as this iterator (after taking  value) as key and fetched value as value
 * 3. HasNext is simply can test does priority queue is empty or not.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * HashNext: O(1) where size is Length of iterators list
 * next: O(1)
 */
class MergeKSortedIteratorsUsingPriorityQueueOnly {


    /**
     * Using Sorted list like data structure;
     * Using Priority Queue
     */
    static class MergingIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {

        private final PriorityQueue<Pair<Iterator<Integer>, Integer>> priorityQueue;


        public MergingIterator(List<Iterator<Integer>> iterators) {

            priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparing(Pair::getValue));
            init(iterators);
        }

        /**
         * O(size * log(size)) where size is Length of iterators list
         */
        private final void init(List<Iterator<Integer>> iterators) {
            for (Iterator<Integer> iterator : iterators) {

                if (iterator.hasNext()) {

                    Integer value = iterator.next();
                    priorityQueue.offer(new Pair<>(iterator, value));
                }
            }

        }

        /**
         * O(1) where size is Length of iterators list

            Pair<Iterator<Integer>, Integer> poll = priorityQueue.poll();

            Integer toReturn = poll.getValue();
            if (poll.getKey().hasNext()) {
                Integer next = poll.getKey().next();
                priorityQueue.offer(new Pair<>(poll.getKey(), next));
            }

            return toReturn;

        }
    }
}

        // Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
        public E peek() {


            return lastElement;
        }

        // hasNext() and next() should behave the same as in the Iterator interface.
        // Override them if needed.
        @Override
        public E next() {

            E toReturn = lastElement;
            if (iterator.hasNext())
                lastElement = iterator.next();
            else
                lastElement = null;

            return toReturn;

        }

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return lastElement != null;
        }
    }


    /**

            priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparing(PeekingIterator::peek));

Simple solution without adding a PeekingIterator. Just keep the next values for each iterator in a Map, and add a custom comparator to the Min-Heap


class MergingIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
  Map<Iterator<Integer>, Integer> peek = new HashMap<>();
  Queue<Iterator<Integer>> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> Integer.compare(peek.get(a), peek.get(b)));
  
  public MergingIterator(List<Iterator<Integer>> iterators) {
    
    for(Iterator<Integer> curr: iterators) {
      if (curr.hasNext()) {
        peek.put(curr, curr.next());
        heap.add(curr);
      }
    }
  }
  
  
  @Override
  public boolean hasNext() {
    return !heap.isEmpty();
  }

  @Override
  public Integer next() {
    if (heap.isEmpty()) {
      return null;
    }
    
    Iterator<Integer> lowest = heap.poll();
    Integer nextVal = peek.get(lowest);
    if (lowest.hasNext()) {
      peek.put(lowest, lowest.next());
      heap.add(lowest);
    }
    
    return nextVal;
  }
}

I got the following Graph question in the telephonic round of GOOGLE:
Given a map of N cities,a thief wants to go from a start city to his hometown .An edge between two cities is bidirectional and has a positive weight that represents distance between the two cities.The thief can go from city X to city Y only if the shortest distance from city Y to his hometown is smaller than the shortest distance from city X to the hometown.
Determine how many routes are possible from start city to his hometown.
Assume that start city is city0 and hometown is cityN-1.


Example :
Input :
N = 5
edges = {{u,v,weight}|u,v are vertices}
E = {{0,1,3},{0,2,3},{1,2,1},{0,3,2},{1,4,2},{2,4,1},{3,4,10}}
Output:
3
0-1-4
0-1-2-4
0-2-4
0-3 edge will be rejected since shortest distance between 3 and 4 is 10 > shortest distance between 0 and 4 which is 4.
Can someone help solving this question?

If there is substring in str1 of length n from [i,i+n] which is equal to substring of length n in str2 from [j,j+n] then the value of j-k+1 will be i+n-j+1. However if we just consider the first (perhaps any single character in the substring) then our pair will be like (i,i) & (j,j) or (i+1,i+1) & (j+1,j+1) and so on, then the value of j-k+1 will be i-j+1 which is n lesser than the previous value. Hence its always optimal to choose a substring of length 1 .


Thus just find the minimum value by traversing for all the 26 letters and count the instances of this minimum value.

Here are the questions I was asked during the google interviews(both phone screen as well as onsites). The position was general swe l4 and location USA.


Q1



Given a bishop on a 8*8 chessboard, find minimum number of moves required to
reach from a given starting point and end point

(Can be solved easily with BFS)
Q2:


Delete node in binary tree
Q3:



Q1: Given a function f, Design rate limiter such that we can't have
no more than k=5 executions of f in 1 second.
(Fixed window algorithms will not work, so I implemented dynamic window algo)

q2: Implement retry logic for failed executions of calls(caused by overflow in last question)
(essentially create another buffer for failed calls)


Q4:





Given a matrix with only 1s and 0s with exactly one square in the matrix,
find
1) the top left coordinate of square
2) area of square

Example: 
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

The output will be (2,1) and 4.
Q5:



Kth element in 2 sorted arrays

Given two sorted arrays find the kth smallest element in the two arrays


Q6:
https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/


Q7:



https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/125301/Find-longest-consecutive-path-in-a-matrix

Essentially this question but a starting point is given.
So it is not the max possible length overall but max possible length from a given starting point

my Amazon interview questions set is here

Q1
For this question, based on how tightly you are adhering to the fact that it's a bishop, you know that you can either not reach the bishop, reach it in one move, or reach it in 2 moves. This is because a move of a bishop can be any number of squares as long as its a straight diagonal move. You can check if you can reach the point if the bishop and target are the same color in a board. From there, you can differentiate the one or 2 move by checking if the point and bishop lie on the same diagonal line.

Below is the implementation If we go by approach when Bishop can move any number of steps on diagonal. Let me know if you see any mistakes with the logic.
What DS/Algo category will this problem fall under ?


class Cell{
      int r;
      int c;
      public Cell(int r, int c){
        this.r=r;
        this.c=c;
      }
}

public int getMinMoves(Cell start, Cell target){
      if(isSameDiagonal(start,target))
        return 1;
      if(isSameColorSquare(start,target))
        return 2;
      return -1;
}

public boolean isSameDiagonal(Cell source, Cell target){
	return Math.abs(source.r - target.r) == Math.abs(source.c - target.c);
}

public boolean isSameColorSquare(Cell source, Cell target){
       return (source.r + source.c)%2 == (target.r + target.c)%2;
}

BTW for Q1, the answer can only be 2,1 or impossible (considering traditional bishop moves).
if the start point and the end-point are not of the same color then impossible.
if start and end are in the same diagonal then 1 move needed. Otherwise, it is always possible to go the end-point in 2 moves :P

I had a google virtual onsite round for their lateral hiring. The question I was giving was:
Let us say that there is a home and a saloon that you want to visit. You have a routes built in across. You need to check that if there is a route that exists that lets you visit the saloon.
For example: Here you have H which denotes your home and R is your route and S is your saloon.
H R R .
R . R .
. . R .
. . S .
I applied DFS and was able to solve this question.


Now there was a follow up to this question: Let us consider that at first there was no route between both of them. And slowly a route starts developing. How will you be able to check that out?
For example:
First:
H . . .
. . . .
. . S.


Second:
H . . .
. R . .
. . S .


Third:
H . . R
. R . .
. . S .


Fourth:
H . . R
R R . .
. . S .
and so on.
I tried a lot on this with different ways but I was not able to reduce its complexity down and my best complexity solution turned out to be naive one. Not able to optimise this was the reason why I got rejected later :(
Any idea how else could this have been solved?

My earlier comment got deleted accidentally. We can use the union find template for the follow up question. Perform union operation on the neighbor cells when a new route is added and keep checking if S and H are connected. Below is a sample template on how to apply union find for grid problems.

Hi all,
Just want to share my google interview experience hope it helps someone


Screening by recruiter:-


Recruiters also do a minor screening process for me they asked the following questions


What is complexity of Merge sort (Best , average and worst)
When would you use BFS to determine the shortest path ? (Unweighted graph)
Calculate 2^22 ( 2^10 approx 1000 so 1000 * 1000 * 4)
Elimination round


Given a binary tree find the length of the longest Arithmetic progression from top to bottom.


                                     20
                        16                       18    
                  2          12               16      16
            -1          14     8           1                14
                                 7                        12
                               6                            10                   
                            5
                          4
                      3
                    2
                 1 
			  -1
For this tree from top to bottom we have multiple APs


20->18->16->14->12->10
20->18->16
20->16->12->8 Edge Case Node is shared
8->7->6->5->4->3->2->1 Edge Case Node is shared
........
(There are many :P APs of shorter length ! )


Among all the APs 8->7->6->5->4->3->2->1 this sequence has the longest length so our answer is 8


Solution :- I was able to solve it using BFS


Follow up:- How would the code change if the question is changed to horizontal for example


				  9
			3           4
		5      6      7   8	
For this find the longest length from 5 -->3 ---> (9,6,7)---> 4--->7 which becomes an n-arry tree


		              5
					  3
				9	  6     7
				      4
					  7
I got call from my recruiter that I'm eligible for Onsite interview. I took 3 weeks to prepare for my onsite


Round1 :-


Given a set of words find the longest sequence of words where each previous word is the prefix of the next word and the next word has just one new character (Let me give an example )


[a,ab,abc,abcd,abcdef,abcdefg,abcdefgh,abcdefghi]


Two sequences


a--> ab-->abc-->abcd
abcdef--->abcdefg--->abcdefgh--->abcdefghi--->abcdefghij
I had to return the the second sequence .


Similar question:-
Thanks @smpavlenko for bringing this to my notice
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/


Solution :- I solved it using Trie and DFS .


Result:- Although I solved it but I missed one edge case which was a red flag and also my code quality and efficiency was poor. They also said I was a little slow


Round 2:-


Given a processor it should pick up a job from set of available jobs and execute the job which has the least running time duration . Jobs are given in the format


[jobId, jobStartTime, durationOfThejob]
Job ID is always unique and there could be multiple jobs starting in the same time


i.e if I've jobs


[1,3,2],[2,3,8],[3,4,1]


answer should be [1,3,2] the sequence of the jobId


Solution :-


I solved it using PriorityQueue and a timer . (I solved this question in 15 mins :P )


Followup:-
What if there were 2 processors how would your code change ?


I used a variable timer to track duration. I just added 2 more timers and made some slight modifications


Similar question :-
The closest question I came across in leetcode for this question was
(1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended)


Please feel free to comment if there's a exact match of this question


Result:- Overall result of this round of positive my code quality was improved, speed also improved


Round 3:-


Exactly this question (947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column) . I didn't see this question before the interview although I was able to explain the logic to the interviewer in 5-10 mins but I got stuck in one portion while coding


Result:- -ve couldn't complete the code on time .


I got a call from my recruiter the next day that they've decided not to go ahead with me :'(


I'm gonna try again after sometime


PS:- Please forgive me for my bad english .


I notice I got some downvotes as well . Can you please help me understand why you downvoted the post so that I can improve it ?

How about:


Sort the stars array based on the x-coordinate.
for every star, check the number of stars that fall within the range of width-x and height-y.
find the maximum from the list obtained in step 2.
Should this be sufficient? Please correct me if I am wrong here.

I can think of solution that works in O(n^2 (logn)).


First sort all stars based on x coordinate. Now iterate through the points, at each point we can form rectangle with base from x to x+width. You can find all points lying in this by range either by binary search of (x+width) (complexity O(logn) for each point) or you can maintain sliding window (O(n) for all points) . Now at each point you know the points within the x coordinate range, out of there point now you have to pick y such that it gives you maximum result. Now for all these points sort their y coordinate (O(nlogn)) and for each y find number of points between y and y+height using binary search. Compare this with global maximum.


In this question I am assuming the rectangles are axis aligned.

I have an idea about a trivial solution of O(n^3). Under the assumption that stars are suppose to be sparse(the distance between the farthest left and farthest right stars are much more than number of stars).


Create a data structure: [xi, yi, ind_i] represents x, y coordinates and index of the star in list stars. O(n)
stars can be then converted into a list of the data structure we just created star_list = [[x0, y0, 0], [x1, y1, 1], ....]
Sort star_list by x O(nlogn)
for loop on x axis, for each position xi, record all starts with xi - width <= x <= xi, convert this list of record into a bitmap. Here we imagine that galaxy start/end at exactly position xi, and see which star can be included into the galaxy in terms of x value. O(n^2), the first n is to iterate all xi, the second n is to look back/forward and see which set of stars can be in range if the galaxy starts at xi, we create bitmap in the same time of second loop so no additional complexity.
Do step 3, 4 for axis y. O(n^2)
Double for loop to compare every single combination of bitmap between bitmaps obtained for x and y axis. Record and return the maximum of bits for bitmap_xi & bitmap_yi.
O(n * n * n), first two n are for double for loop, the third n is for bit comparison, because we can have n bits in total, so I multiply another n here.

were you given any sizes for this question? Like what was the base case/ example they gave you?
It seems like we could possibly use math based off of you Star class. If its similar to just a regular node class that is. My original approach would be solve it by using area. You already have length and width in the star property so we just need to know how big is the rectangle correct? Let me know if im misinterpreting this because I could be wrong

    Console.WriteLine($"Maximum stars that fit in the rectangle: {maxStars}");
}
}


In this C# implementation:


We define a Star class with X and Y properties.
The MaxStarFitInRect method takes a list of stars and the width and height of the rectangle.
It iterates through each star and checks if its X and Y coordinates fall within the rectangle's boundaries.
If a star's coordinates are within the rectangle, it increments the count.
Finally, it returns the count of stars that fit inside the rectangle.

For R2:
EDIT: Solution is for task when only available directions are bottom,left,right.
Do DFS from each empty cell from top row.
Mark current cell as visited and if you explore all neighbours of current cell than mark it back as unvisited.
You will also need DP[row][length][DirectionFromWhereYouCame]. As you dfs will also have param DirectionFromWhereYouCame as its important to memorize.
DirectionFromWhereYouCame=can be only 0,1,2 as we only move right,left,bottom.
Time Complexity : rowscolumnsDirectionFromWhereYouCame=rowscolumns3=rowscolumns= O(rowscolumns)
Space: rows*columns



public int findLongestPath(char[][] matrix) {
  if (matrix == null || matrix[0].length==0) return -1;
  
  int finalRes = -1;
  int[][][] dp = new int[matrix.length+1][matrix[0].length+1][3];
  for (int i=0; i<dp.length; i++) {
    for (int j=0; j<dp[0].length; j++) Arrays.fill(dp[i][j], -2);
  }
  boolean[][] visited = new boolean[matrix.length][matrix[0].length];
  for (int i=0; i<matrix[0].length; i++) {
      int res = dfs(0,j, matrix, dp, 2);
      finalRes = Math.max(finalRes, res, visited);    
      if (matrix[0][j] == '.' || matrix.length == 1) {
        finalRes = Math.max(1, finalRes);
      }
  }
  
  return finalRes;

public boolean isValid(int r, int c, char[][] matrix) {

}

    int res = dfs(newR,newC, matrix, dp, visited, i); //dfs will give you longest path from newR,newC until you exit MAZE
    finalRes = Math.max(res, finalRes);
  }

R1 Question:
< Jake >Hello!!There
< Andrew >How Are!! You?
.... so on
Can Jake chat again? In that case do we store Jake's word count in some auxillary hashmap?

Java Solution:
We need a 3D matrix to store the info from which direction we come to this co-ordinate
Note - the solution count the number of nodes in the path



public class Main {

    static int[][][] dp;
    static int[][] dir = new int[][]{{0, -1}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}};

    public static void main(String[] args) {

                {'.', '#', '#', '.', '.', '#', '#'},
                {'.', '#', '#', '.', '.', '#', '#'},
                {'.', '#', '#', '#', '.', '.', '#'},
                {'.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '#', '#'}};
        int m = matrix.length, n = matrix[0].length;
        dp = new int[m][n][3];
        for (int[][] row : dp)
            for(int[] col : row)
                Arrays.fill(col, -1);
        int result = 0;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int leftOrRight = Math.max(solve(0, i, 0,matrix,visited), solve(0, i, 1, matrix, visited));
            int leftOrRightorDown = Math.max(leftOrRight, solve(0, i, 2,matrix,visited));
            result = Math.max(result, leftOrRightorDown);        }
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    private static int solve(int i, int j, int direction, char[][] matrix, boolean[][] visited) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= matrix.length || j >= matrix[0].length || visited[i][j])
            return 0;

        if (dp[i][j][direction] != -1)
            return dp[i][j][direction];

        if (matrix[i][j] == '#' || i == matrix.length - 1)
            return 0;

        int maxPath = 0;
        visited[i][j] = true;
        for (int k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
            maxPath = Math.max(maxPath, solve(i + dir[k][0], j + dir[k][1], k, matrix, visited));
        }
        visited[i][j] = false;
        return dp[i][j][direction] = maxPath + 1;
    }

For R1,


public static List findTopKchattyPeople(List logs, int k) {
List topChatty = new ArrayList<>();
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
int n = logs.size();


	// Put (Person, # of chat words) at map
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		String log = logs.get(i);
		Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(log);
		int m = 0;
		String person = "";
		while (matcher.find()) {
			m++;

			if (m == 1)
				person = matcher.group();
		}
		map.put(person, map.getOrDefault(person, 0) + m);
	}

	Set<Entry<String, Integer>> set = map.entrySet();
	PriorityQueue<Entry<String, Integer>> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> (b.getValue() - a.getValue()));
	pq.addAll(set);

	for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
		topChatty.add(pq.poll().getKey());

You cannnot split by a space
and word count not length of string count should be computed
Seems trivial but how do we most efficiently get the word count? using regex?
len(re.findall("[a-zA-Z_]+", string)) ?

Given a matrix, we can consider any point on the first row as entry point and any point on last row as exit point. # is a wall and . is empty space. Find the path with max length. You can only go down, right or left and visit each cell only once.


I gave a DFS brute force approach but the interviewer wanted a DP solution.


eg matrix:


"#.#..#",
"#.#..#",
"#.##.#",
"#..#.#",
"#..#.#",
"#..#.#"

dp[i][j][dir] - 3d DP with dir (direction) as LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN


dp[i][j][k] denotes max path length from cell (i, j) to bottom of the matrix if I go in direction k from cell (i,j)


Let's fill from bottom row.


Base case:
dp[n-1][j][k] = 1 for all j and k wherever empty space is present, -INF otherwise


State transitions:


dp[i][j][DOWN] = 1 + max(dp[i+1][j][DOWN], dp[i+1][j][LEFT], dp[i+1][j][RIGHT])
dp[i][j][LEFT] = 1 + max(dp[i][j-1][DOWN], dp[i][j-1][LEFT])
dp[i][j][RIGHT] = 1 + max(dp[i][j+1][DOWN], dp[i][j+1][RIGHT])
Max of top row values is the answer.


I didn't account for # in state transitions but handling that is trivial. (dp[i][j][k] will be -INF for all k if cell (i, j) contains wall #)


The tricky part is order of state transitions.


For all elements in ith row: 
- First calculate dp[i][j][DOWN]
- Then dp[i][j][LEFT] from j = 0 to n
- And then dp[i][j][RIGHT] from n-1 to 0.
If we do so there won't be any cyclical dependency. Otherwise, if we try to compute dp[i][j][DOWN], dp[i][j][LEFT], dp[i][j][RIGHT], for cell (i, j) at once, then there will be unresolved dependencies like dp[i][j][RIGHT] depending on dp[i][j+1][DOWN] and dp[i][j+1][RIGHT] which may not have been populated at that time.


C++ code using top-down approach


#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> grid;
int M, N;
vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp;

int solve(int r, int c, int k){
    if(dp[r][c][k] != -1)

        dp[r][c][k] = max(solve(r, c-1, 1), solve(r, c-1, 2)) + 1;
    }
    else{
        dp[r][c][k] = max(solve(r-1, c, 2), max(solve(r-1, c, 0), solve(r-1, c, 1))) + 1;

You have a write a simple "Anti-Virus" application which scans all the files on the systems and revomes known "Malwares" if present any. You are provided a database of malwares MD5 hash.
The basic functionality involves walking the filesystem, hashing each file, checking with DB if is a known malware or not. The process is interruptible by Apllication shutdown, machine reboot etc.., but on startup it should continue scanning from the last file path accessed instead of rescanning all previously examined files.

As file system is a tree like structure, AntiVirus can scan from a drive (considering its a windows system), take all directories as its children node. and scan them one by one, alphabetically.
So a BFS scan should work.
Now when a file is scanned it would generate MD5 hash of that file's content and match with its existing database, It can be log(N) complexity if binary searched or if the database is a hashtable then, O(1) search can be done.
When the scan of a file is completed it will update the current completed node to this file, and move for next one. So that if rebooted, instead of searching fromt he beginning it can start after that file.


Edge case scenario:


improper shutdown: while updating current scanned file, if improper shutdown happens, the file can be corrupted. To avoid that, we can use 2 files (recent_scanned, before_recent_scanned). and update before_recent_scanned first by copying the recent_scanned, and then write in recent_scanned file. this way, it is possible to prevent corruption of the files.


some files are copied: while scanning, user can copy some files from one directory to another directory. Here's two scenarios can be happened. Either he is copying something from already scanned to another location or he can copy non-scanned files to scanned location. We can ignore the first case (for better optimization we can also consider this case). For second case, We can make a list of those files and save it for scan later. Or we can also scan before writing that file. For all of these we have to use system api.


New file written by some programs: If any new file is written by some other programs, with system API we can also know which files are written, and scan them.


Optimization: To optimize, we can use multithreading, All worker threads will take a file from current pointer, save the file name to disk/ (in a file named, currently_scanning.txt), and start scanning, when finished, remove that file name from the disk and continue taking another non-scanned file from the pointer. While taking a new file, it must lock the current pointer file to avoid duplicate scanning by another thread. To create better user experience, it can check current processor idle status, free ram etc. and update total thread count if necessary.


virus database updated: virus database can be updated frequently as new viruses released very often. If a complete scan happens earlier, anti-virus program can save the md5 hash in a file and cross check with the updated virus hashes.


These are the ideas that came into my mind. Let me know if there's a better way to resolve this.

Seems like shortest path in unweighted graph. BFS. You haven't said how we can hop though. Assuming it's by changing one letter.

There are total two questions to attempt within 60 minutes of time.


PR Strings


Problem Statement :
You are given String S of lowercase alphabets. In one operation, you can remove the substring "pr" from the string S and get amount X or you can remove the substring "rp" from the string S and get the amount Y.


Find the maximum amount you can get if you perform zero or more such operations optimally.


Input Format
First Line contains number of testcase T.
First line of each testcase contains a string S
Second line contains two spaced integers X and Y


Sample Input


3
abppprrr
5 4
prprprrp
7 10
abcdpqrpqr
3 4
Sample Output


15
37
4
Explaination
Testcase 1 -
Remove "pr", S becomes "abpprr".
Remove "pr", S becomes "abpr".
Remove "pr", S becomes "ab".
Hence - 3x5 = 15


Testcase 2 -
Remove "rp", S becomes "prprrp"
Remove "rp", S becomes "prrp"
Remove "rp", S becomes "pr"
Remove "rp", S becomes " "


Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= |S| <= 100000
1 <= X <= 100
1 <= Y <= 100

A simple solution, to count 'p' or 'r' first depending on X & Y values.
Initialization contains some char init which will take care of condition with same code.


int calculatePoints(string S, int x, int y) {
int res = 0, cnt1 = 0, cnt2 = 0, inc1, inc2;
char ch1, ch2;

if(x > y) {
    ch1 = 'p'; ch2 = 'r'; inc1 = x; inc2 = y;
} else {
    ch1 = 'r'; ch2 = 'p'; inc1 = y; inc2 = x;
}

for(char ch : S) {
    if(ch == ch1) {
        cnt1++;
    } else if(ch == ch2) {
        if(cnt1 > 0) {
            cnt1--;
            res += inc1;
        }
        else
            cnt2++;
    }
}
// now, if cnt1 and cnt2 != 0
if(cnt1 != 0 && cnt2 != 0) {
    res += min(cnt1, cnt2)*inc2;
}
return res;
}

Here is solution using recursion:
'''


	int maxValue(String s, int x, int y) {
		int [] res = new int [] {0};

You are given a string S (consisting of lowercase English characters).


In one operation, you can remove the substring "pr" from the string S and get the amount X or you can remove the substring "rp" from the string S and get the amount Y.


Find the maximum amount you can get if you perform zero or more such operations optimally.


Note:
Substring of string S is defined as a continuous sequence of characters in S.
After removal of substring "pr" or "rp" from S, the rest of the characters in S remains in the same order.


Input Format:


First Line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
First Line of each test case contains a string S.
Second Line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y.
Output Format:


For each test case print a single integer denoting maximum amount you can get in a new line.


Constraints:


1 <= T <= 10
1 <= |S| <= 100000
1 <= X <= 100
1 <= Y <= 100


Sample Input:
3
abppprrr
5 4
prprprrp
7 10
abcdpqrpqr
3 4


Sample Output:
15
37
4


Explanation:


S = "abppprrr", X = 5, y = 4


Remove substrings as mentioned:


Remove "pr", new string S = "abpprr"
Remove "pr", new string S = "abpr"
Remove "pr", new string S = "ab"


In total, we remove "pr" 3 times. Hence answer is = 5+5+5 = 15


The idea behind the solution:


First, we check either X is greater than Y or not if X > Y then removing "pr" will give us greater value and if Y > X then "rp" gives more.
We should greedily remove "pr" or "rp" depending upon either X is greater or Y is greater.
We will be using a stack to keep the order same after removal of substrings.
After removing all possible "pr" we will check in rest of the string if any "rp" present and we will remove them and vice versa.
Python Solution
def rp(string, x, y, ans, flag):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == 'p':
            if stack and stack[-1] == 'r':
                ans[0] += y
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    if flag:
        pr("".join(stack), x, y, ans, False)


def pr(string, x, y, ans, flag):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == 'r':
            if stack and stack[-1] == 'p':
                ans[0] += x  
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    if flag:
        rp("".join(stack), x, y, ans, False)
    
def solve():

    string = input()
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    ans = [0]

    if x  > y:
        pr(string, x, y, ans, True)
    else:
        rp(string, x, y, ans, True)
    print(ans[0])
        

for _ in range(int(input())):
    solve()
Complexity Analysis:


Time complexity is O(n), where n = length of string S.
Space Complexity O(n) extra auxilary space for the stack.

You can do it also in O(1) memory and still in O(n) time and that is obviously optimal here.
If Y>X then just swap letters 'p' and 'r' in the string and swap X and Y. So you can assume that X>=Y.
A block is a sequence of letters that contain only p and r letters, if you remove some pr, rp strings you will still remain in the same block. As mentioned the greedy works here, so first remove only pr from string, for this count the 'p' and 'r' letters in the string. You can easily check whether you can remove a pr from the string or not: if you see 'r' and count_p>0.
Notice that after these pr removal operations you would left the block as rrrrpppppppp so some r (possibly zero) and after that some p, from this you can make min(count_p,count_r) rp strings.
Not tested [only the sample input], but should be good.


int pr_string(string s,int X,int Y){
    
    int n=s.length();
    
    if(Y>X){
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(s[i]=='p')s[i]='r';
            else if(s[i]=='r')s[i]='p';
        }
        swap(X,Y);
    }
    // now X>=Y
    int ans=0;
    int count_p=0;
    int count_r=0;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(s[i]=='p')  count_p++;
        else if(s[i]=='r'){
            if(count_p>0)  { count_p--; ans+=X; }
            else  count_r++;
        }
        else{
            ans+=min(count_p,count_r)*Y;
            count_p=0;
            count_r=0;
        }
    }
    ans+=min(count_p,count_r)*Y;
    return ans;
}

int main(void){
    
    cout<<pr_string("abppprrr",5,4)<<endl;
    cout<<pr_string("prprprrp",7,10)<<endl;
    cout<<pr_string("abcdpqrpqr",3,4)<<endl;
 
    return 0;
}
// output: 15 37 4

Here is a solution using memoization.
Just remember the string previously encountered and avoid recalculation.


t = int(input())


def solve(st, memo, x, y):
    if st in memo:
        return memo[st]

    if st == "pr":
        return x

    if st == "rp":
        return y

    if st.count("p") == 0 or st.count("r") == 0:
        return 0

    if len(st) <=1:
        return 0

    memo[st] = 0
    for i in range(len(st)):
        if st[i] == "p":
            if i+1<len(st) and st[i + 1] == "r":
                memo[st] = max(memo[st], solve(st[0:i]+st[i+2:], memo, x, y) + x)
        if st[i] == "r":
            if i+1<len(st) and st[i + 1] == "p":
                memo[st] = max(memo[st], solve(st[0:i]+st[i+2:], memo, x, y) + y)

    return memo[st]


for _ in range(t):
    st = input().strip()
    x, y = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    memo = {}
    print(solve(st, memo, x, y))

Length of the minimum consecutive subarray with sum = K
Input K = 5, buckets = {1 2 2 5 4 1}
Output 1


int minBucketsWithSumK(int k, vector<int> buckets) {
  if (buckets.empty() || k <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  int size = buckets.size();
  int j = 0, i = 0, sum = 0;
  int result = INT_MAX;
  
  while (i < size) {
    // First Running i until sum < k
    while (sum < k && i < size) {
      sum += buckets[i];
      i++;
    }

    // Then, Running j until sum > k
    while (sum > k && j < i) {
      sum -= buckets[j];
      j++;
    }    
  
    if (sum == k) {
      result = min(result, i-j);
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}

The above code will give an ifinite loop for above input as once i = 3 and j = 0 and sum = 5, it will go in an ifinite solution.


int minBucketsWithSumK(int k, vector<int> buckets) {
  if (buckets.empty() || k <= 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  int size = buckets.size();
  int j = 0, i = 0, sum = 0;
  int result = INT_MAX;
  
  while (i < size) {
    // First Running i until sum < k
    while (sum < k && i < size) {
      sum += buckets[i];
      i++;
    }

    // Then, Running j until sum > k
    while (sum > k && j < i) {
      sum -= buckets[j];
      j++;
    }    
  
    if (sum == k) {
      result = min(result, i-j);
	 
	 // UPDATE: move i to the next index and update sum
	  if (i < size) {
        sum += buckets[i++];
      }
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}

Adding the above update in the code solves the purpose, but is not a neat way. Can anyone provide an alternate way to fix the above code using same two inner loops logic?

Given an array consisting of N distinct integers and another array consisting of M integers(not necessarily distinct) . You need to find out the minimum number of elements added to B so that A becomes the subsequence of B.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements from the sequence without changing the order of remaining elements.
Input format
First line contains T (number of testcases)
for each test case
first line has N and M
second line contains N integers seperated by space
Third line contains M integers seperated by space
Output
Output the min no of elements to be added to array B so that the array A becomes the sub sequence of B


Constraints
1 < T <= 10
1 < N < 10^7
1 < M < 10^7


I tried this way.... but did not get accepted
I have found out the length of the longest common subsequence of array A and array B using Dynamic programming.
Then I returned*** min(0, len(A) - lengthofcommonsubsequenceofAandB)***
I is showing me the memory error..
So I again tried using 2 x N matrix but there my code was showing the time limit exceeded. where did I go wrong???


If any one has the solution or knows how to solve this please help me....

Replace all known elements in B with:


B*[i] = j where A[j] = B[i] (A is unique Array)
B*[i] = None where there exists no A[j] = B[i]
If we do LIS on B* array we will find the maximum Length of A which can be created from existing B.
The answer should be A.size() - LIS(B*).

It is one of the common problems which related to LCS and LIS, so since the first array(A) would be having distinct elements, then just remove the elements from B which are not present in A. later on replace the remaining elements of B with the corresponding index of A,and then find LIS using nlogn method.


for eg.
A = 32 23 11
B = 4 23 32 5 32 11


after removing non-existent elements
newB = 23 32 32 11


replace newB with indices
newB = [1,0,0,2]


just find the LIS of newB using nlogn method,

A quick version without cleaning up the conditions and statements. You can cut down 1 of the initial ifs by ordering, but I want to make it explicit. You can also use an int to take in the comparison value too. Also, I don't think any memoization is needed since the previous index always gets reset, and both are only incrementing. Correct me if I'm wrong.

you should be using the lcs in nlogn time complexity based on the constraints given in question
Its already described in some previous posts of this question

I believe this is similar to finding the Shortest Common Supersubsequence

thanks for sharing. could you please edit the question to remove M/N - A/B confusion?

here we have may leetcode dission urls and there are dissuciocins in that link below it. I need you to create a summariy of all these discusiosin intoa  table so the link would be one column, the questions ouwld bne another column and the links to leetcode questions if available would be one columns. so per link there cna be multiple ques
